# Image-Classifier-to-identify-Flower-species-from-an-image
This project uses convolutional neural network to train an image classifier that is able to identify 102 different flower species with 93% testing accuracy. This image classifier can be used to identify flower species from new images, e.g., in a phone app that tells you the name of the flower your camera is looking at.
